The first time I volunteered for a Bitcoin conference I met many bitcoiners for the first time. I'm what some people might call socially awkward. We were called nerds back on my day. As a nerd, it's difficult for me to talk to people about Bitcoin. Most of the time people don't even understand the concept I am talking about: Peer-To-Peer electronic cash.

I have been a peer-to-peer network nerd for 25 years. Ironically that makes me feel more comfortable with many of the podcasters and developers in black hoodies than I feel around people wearing suits. The second time I went to a podcast a dude wearing a suit told me he worked on data vending machines. That's more of a "shadowy super coder" ethos than wearing a black hoodie. l still don't get it. Still too socially awkward.

Like [Satoshi says]([https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/167/](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/167/)),"**Sorry to be a wet blanket.  Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard.  There's nothing to relate it to."**

It's easy to write about Bitcoin to nostr nerds and stacker news enthusiasts, but **it's more difficult to write about our beloved peer-to-peer network and digital signatures to socially adept people**. Socially adept people pay for fancy shoes, fancy pants, and fancy conference tickets. These things signal trust.  [Shawn Yaeger has an awesome podcast about the way trust is changing in the electronic age]([https://fountain.fm/show/Mk0fJte5vrfiDQ5RyCZd](https://fountain.fm/show/Mk0fJte5vrfiDQ5RyCZd)). Much of this is centered around cryptography because it gives us the super-power of [non-repudiation]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-non-repudiation/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-non-repudiation/)). This will be increasingly important in a world where everyone thinks everyone else is an AI bot.

But first, you should learn:
- Bitcoin is peer=-to-peer electronic cash
- Bitcoin is not actually held in a bitcoin wallet like paper fiat money.
- This electronic cash is held on a peer-to-peer network like BitTorrent where people can download free and open source software like [TAILS]([https://tails.net/install/download/index.en.html](https://tails.net/install/download/index.en.html)) on a [peer-to-peer network]([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-p2p-peer-to-peer-process/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-p2p-peer-to-peer-process/)).
- Bitcoin is not actually held in a bitcoin wallet like paper fiat money.
- Economics nerds like the way Saifadeen Amous Describes this p2p network in his book,[The Bitcoin Standard]([https://academy.saifedean.com/product/tbs-hardcover/](https://academy.saifedean.com/product/tbs-hardcover/))
- I describe a bitcoin private key composed of 12 words as 12 PIN's. For a general audiance, that means a big "PIN number."
- If you are the only person with this PIN, nobody can spend your bitcoin, even if you're stuck in a country that bans your gold, social credit score, the usefullness of your national currencies value, or whatever.
- If you lose this PIN, you hodl forever. [Like Satoshi said]():
```
"Lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone."
```

I first started doing this on yalls.org in 2019, but the technology was too early. It's improved in the last six months or so. Rumble allows creators to accept bitcoin on the platform. I know it's not the perfect, cypherpunk solution, but I want to try it. I still believe Nobel Peace Prize winners like Machado deserve to use money even if dictators don't allow them to be president. [Like she said as described in Ross Stephen's letter]([https://www.stoneridgeam.com/insights/stone-ridge-2025-investor-letter](https://www.stoneridgeam.com/insights/stone-ridge-2025-investor-letter)),

"***The world knows of Chavez and Maduro's human rights abuses, but less about their violations of financial rights, turning a functional economy into a catastrophic financial crisis. In 2018, inflation reached 1.7 million percent. This financial repression rooted in state sponsored looting, theft, and money printing happened despite our vast natural resources.*****"

[Bitcoin is dead]([https://bitcoindeaths.com/](https://bitcoindeaths.com/)) again. The socially adept people call it a catastrophe. It reminds me of that proverb. Like Ross Stephens said, "**They tried to bury us.
They didn’t know we were seeds.**"

Bitcoin is not dead. It's F-You money. The socially adept people tell me that phrase is more acceptable than my favorite word that you won't find in the ditionary.I hope this video helps socially adept people WTF Is A Bitcoin Wallet.
