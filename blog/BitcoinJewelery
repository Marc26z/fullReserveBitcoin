I want to teach my kids about digital gold so I bought them a little analog gold to scaffold this lesson. How can one learn about digital gold if they don't first learn of analog gold? I figure it's better to show them a traditional bearer asset than lecture them about this new bearer asset. 

So I brought my son a 14kt gold rope necklace. My wife said necklaces need a medallion. I don't know much about these things, but I decided to make my own. My daughter is a little older and has a debit card so I plan on giving her a satscard, but that's another story.

## This Medallion Holds A UTXO

I asked for some open dimes
from my Secret Santa A few years ago. My mother-in-law bought me a few. I hid them in my a wooden bowel while plotting my plans to use them. I decided to give him one of the [Open Dimes](https://opendime.com/) his grandmother bought me. 

I also created a [sat swear](https://primal.net/marc/the-sat-swear-jar) jar because he got annoyed when I talked about Bitcoin. I used the sats from this jar and added some more to make a UTXO of 100,000 sats. This is 1-1000th of a whole Bitcoin. I can't afford to give him a whole one, but 1/1000th of a whole coin was within my price range.

I think the open dome with 100,000 sats will be worth than the necklace someday, when people understand what it is, but we're still in the phase where most people think Bitcoin has no utility value aside from gambling for fiat. My goal is to teach my son that Bitcoin is much more than that. He knows:

- Bitcoin can be sent at the speed of light using the lightning network.
- Bitcoin is a store of value and can be stored in a medallion you wear on a gold chain. He will learn that this Christmas at least.

  How do you teach your children about bitcoin?
