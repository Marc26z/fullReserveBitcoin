Washing The Invisible Hand With Soapminer' Soap

The article discusses the author's experience with purchasing soap made by a nostr rounder called Soapminer, who sells soap made from beef tallow in exchange for bitcoin. The author explains how they found out about Soapminer through their web of trust and decided to purchase the soap due to its natural ingredients and open-source production process. They also mention the benefits of using tallow soap over commercial soaps, as it doesn't strip the skin and can help prevent wrinkles and acne. The author emphasizes their support for participating in the bitcoin circular economy by buying from other bitcoiners, citing the invisible hand concept from Adam Smith to explain their motivation. Overall, the article highlights the importance of supporting small businesses within the bitcoin community and the advantages of using a circular economy based on bitcoin transactions.

">article about Soap Miner's soap. I ordered 4 bars and am finally down to the last one in the garage so I ordered some more. Unlike fiat, quality lasts.



He also has updated his inventory. I use different soaps for different threat models. I use unscented in the kitchen because the color doesn't clash with the soap dish(My wife cares about these things). I shower with Cedarwood Tallow and the redacted pumice soap cleans my garden stained hands the best.

Review

So I made something I call a value 4 value ad. The idea was to make a commercial for soap miner. Then Kanye said,

nostr:nevent1qqst098ea86nkjrvrgxgsdqmqgvyn74gupda48pggdzr7deffv95laqppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp0qgspvkuax73gjqcs8tu66fqrd0w9gfcgstqp4h2327gle9nxze704sgrqsqqqqqp8aqquq

 it's a review, not an ad.



He's probably right, but I don't feel like changing my new Value 4 Value Ad website. I probably should though. Maybe later, meanwhile, check out my Soap Miner review.

This soap is available at https://soapminer.com/
